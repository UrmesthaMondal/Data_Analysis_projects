## Importance of sales dashboard-
A sales dashboard is a tool that enables c-level executives and managers to effectively control sales KPIs and monitor them in one central place while helping teams to reach sales goals through detailed analyses of sales performance, cycle lengths, and sales funnels.Sales departments need to have strong ownership of their pipelines, data at their fingertips, and accurate information at any given point in time. By using modern sales dashboards, the performance of the team, sales opportunities, closed deals, various other sales KPIs, and sales management on a daily or strategic level become simplified and easier to follow.

Trying to navigate all the sales tasks while increasing revenue and profits, forecasting and comparing data swiftly and accurately is of utmost importance for busy bees like sales representatives, managers, and VPs. To have a complete 360Â° overview of sales information, having real-time data overview in terms of company targets, visualizing the progress, and sharing the information with clients or stakeholders, sales dashboards will enable full control for the top-level executives.

## The Project:
In this project, I have created a dashboard for a global superstore to have a quick glance at their progress in terms of different KPIs, which will allow them to make necessary adjustments in order to reach their targets.

### Metrics Visualized:
