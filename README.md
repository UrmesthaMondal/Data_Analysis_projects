## What is Data analytics ?
Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to gain information about the data and draw conclusions from it.This involves analyzing raw data to see if patterns, trends, or insights can help inform us about our data set and also involves collecting, cleaning, then compiling the data in certain ways.Various approaches to this include looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics).

## Why data analytics is important ?
Data analysis identifies inefficiencies and bottlenecks in business processes, providing opportunities to mitigate them. By revealing trends and patterns, data analysis uncovers new market opportunities and avenues for expansion. Data analysis helps identify unnecessary spending and underperforming assets, facilitating more efficient resource allocation.
