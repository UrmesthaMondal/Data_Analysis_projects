# Music effects on mental Health
Music therapy, or MT, involves using music to help people reduce stress, lift their mood, and enhance their overall mental health. It's scientifically proven, as music can stimulate the release of "happy" hormones like oxytocin, which help us feel good.Music therapy isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. It includes a wide variety of music genres, tailored to fit the unique needs of different organizations and individuals. This means what works for one person might be different for another, making MT a highly personalized form of therapy.
This dataset is a research project that aims to uncover connections between people's music preferences and their self-reported mental health. By analyzing this data, researchers hope to improve how MT is applied and gain deeper insights into how music affects the mind. This could lead to more effective treatments and a better understanding of the psychological impact of music.

This project explores the relationship between music preferences, listening habits, and mental health indicators such as anxiety and depression using a global survey dataset
